## 💬 Feedback
### Feedback morning
Can you give us feedback on the workshop so far? Please mention
(at least) one thing that went well and one thing that can be improved.
Think of the pace, the instructors, balance between exercises and live coding, the room, anything!

#### 👍 What went well?
- Very nice to be able to bring all the stuff from the past days + bootcamp in practice
- Nice to put things into practice 
- Great to work individually on the challenge with the possibility to colaborate with others.

#### 👎 What can be improved?
- Nothing I can currently think of
- Na
- We could have worked with the same project structure as the PreFer challenge, because at the moment of the submission we had to completely change how our code works and try to understand how the different parts of the PreFer repository work.
